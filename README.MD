#Flashcards Prototype (for iOS)
The purpose of this project was to create an interactive application which resembled the flashcards used by students.  
My role was to create an iPhone app prototype which would demonstrate the idea at the first milestone of the project.  
In addition, it would be the first iteration of the actual design used for <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sparknotes.com/flashcards">SparkNotes Flashcards</a>.

# Notices
The sample data itself has been omitted from the project, since I would prefer to keep that separate.
