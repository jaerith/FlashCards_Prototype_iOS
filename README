# Bibliophile (for iOS)
Bibliophile+ is an iOS mobile application (mainly intended for phones) that was intended for the use of bibliophiles, 
especially those that were interested in how books influenced and reflected the world around them.  From inspiring songs to
showcasing physical locations, the goal of the app was to serve as an interactive encyclopedia for such trivia.

# Notices
The trivia data itself has been omitted from the project, since I would prefer to keep that separate.
